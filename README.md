Here is a professional README that discusses the CRUD concept used in the BookStore project:

# BookStore

BookStore is a web application designed to manage a collection of books. It provides a user-friendly interface for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books.

## CRUD Operations in BookStore

### Create
Users can add new books to the collection by providing details such as the title, author, and description. The new book is then stored in the database.

### Read
Users can view the list of all books in the collection. Each book's details, such as title, author, and description, are displayed. Users can also search for specific books.

### Update
Users can update the details of existing books. This includes modifying the title, author, and description. The changes are then saved to the database.

### Delete
Users can delete books from the collection. Once a book is deleted, it is removed from the database and no longer displayed in the list.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
